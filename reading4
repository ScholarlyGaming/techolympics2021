//End result of boop, bip, bop, and makeNice is the creation of a kind of timer.
//Each time you press the button, one "second" passes.
//When this would increase the number of "seconds" to or beyond 60, a "minute" is added.
//And when this would increase the number of "minutes" to or beyond 60, an "hour" is added.
//bip is the function that controls "minutes", adding one minute whenever 60 seconds is reached and
//    resetting the number of minutes/ triggering bop to add one hour when 60 minutes is reached.
