I simply used if/elif/else checks to solve this problem. The code is in Python 3.

It accepts standard input and interactive terminal input but interactive terminal input will make it easier to read. After hitting ENTER with a number in the prompt, the output will go on a new line.

I did not make the program loop as I was unsure if that would be wanted.
