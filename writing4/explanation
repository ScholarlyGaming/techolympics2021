This is very similar to the previous pebble problem.

The only major differences:
  - Attempting to use an even number of pebbles will tell the user to pick an odd number (in keeping with game rules)
  - The computer has a goal of leaving the human 1 pebble, so it will always try to give the human 4k+1 pebbles
      - It will play p%4-1 pebbles if given p pebbles; if this is -1, it will adjust it to 3
  - The computer does not accept playing with 4k+1 pebbles and will force the player to go first so that it can win
  
This required me to reuse some logic so that the player's first turn if the computer refuses to play first will work 100% of the time. This is necessary if the player gives the computer 1 pebble, in which case it will give it to the player and win immediately. I also relabeled everything to counters.

This program also runs in Python 3 and uses the interactive interpreter to run.
